<!-- PR Template for Sandbox Proposal -->

Use this template to propose a new sandbox project. Your commit should reflect the desired change against the list of projects listed on the TAC page. (delete this paragraph.)

#### Does the Project have a minimum of two maintainers with different company affiliations?

#### Is the Project aligned with the OpenSSF mission _and_ either is a novel approach for existing areas, addresses an unfulfilled need, or is initial code needed for OpenSSF WG work. It is preferred that extensions of existing OpenSSF projects collaborate with the existing project rather than seek a new project.

#### Is an existing Project being contributed to the OpenSSF?


#### If contributing an existing Project to the OpenSSF, has the contribution undergone license and IP due diligence by the Linux Foundation (LF)? Please provide legal information.
