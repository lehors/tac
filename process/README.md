# I. Overview

This document describes the Open Source Security Foundation (OpenSSF) life cycle process for Technical Initiatives, both Working Groups and Projects.

The authority that governs this process is as follows:

The parent organizational structure grants governance to the downward in the organizational structure.  In turn the receiving Working Group or Project report health, participation, outcomes, statuses, etc up the chain.

    A[Governing Board] <--> B[TAC]
    B <--> C[Working Group]
    B <--> E[Working Group]
    C <--> D[Project]
    B <--> F[Project]
    B <--> G[Project]
    E <--> H[Project]
    E <--> I[Project]
```

The process is designed to be flexible to enable a Project to move in and out of a Working Group as deemed appropriate by the TAC.
