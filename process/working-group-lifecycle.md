# Working Group (WG) Life Cycle

Working Groups are under the direct governance of a Special Interest Group (SIG) which can create and close them as necessary and appropriate. WGs are expected to have a very specific goal and not necessarily live for a very long time.

The lifecycle of WGs is therefore minimal and is as follows.

## Active

* The WG is actively pursuing its goal.

## Inactive

* The WG is no longer active, either it has completed its mission or the mission was abandoned.
